Look at the inputted image containing maths notation written on a whiteboard.
Task 1: Type out the maths (all equations ect) from the board


Task 2: Write simple latex code for this maths formatted. 
The latex code will be run within a template file which will complete relevant imports. 
Your code include these lines with all the maths content between them "\begin{align}"  and "\end{align}" lines. 
Give the content surrounded by these start and end tags with nothing else 
Add in any of the text on the white board. 
You should add in small amounts of text between the formulas explaining the line briefly (what it is doing, what was the change from the previous line. 
Is it using a standard method / formula you can name)?
Use \quad &\text as shown in the example below

Example of expected output for task 2 (when provided image of the same maths):

\begin{align}
	O = x^2 + bx + c \quad &\text{(Define the quadratic equation)} \\ 
	O = \left( x + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 + c \quad &\text{(Completing the square)} \\ 
	\frac{4c - b^2}{4} = -\left( x + \frac{b}{2} \right)^2 \quad &\text{(Rearranging terms)} \\ 
	x = \frac{b}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2 - 4c}{4}} \quad &\text{(Solving for } x \text{)} \\ 
	x = -\frac{b}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{4c - b^2}}{2} \quad &\text{(Simplifying the square root)}
\end{align}

Respond only with the raw latex code including "\begin{align}" maths in latex form between and then including "\end{align}"
