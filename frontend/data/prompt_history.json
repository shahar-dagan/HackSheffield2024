Core Concepts:**\n   - Definition and Principles of FPTP: Understand what FPTP is, and the principles behind it.\n   - FPTP in the Context of Other Voting Systems: Understand how FPTP works compared to other voting systems.\n   - Advantages and Disadvantages of FPTP: Be aware of the pros and cons of FPTP.\n   - Influence of FPTP on Electoral Outcomes and Political Landscapes: Understand the effects of FPTP on election results and the larger political context.\n  \n**2. Learning Path:**\n   - Begin with the definition and principles of FPTP.\n   - Move to comparing and contrasting FPTP with other voting systems.\n   - Proceed to understanding the advantages and disadvantages of FPTP.\n   - Finally, delve into how FPTP influences electoral outcomes and political landscapes, particularly in the UK.\n\n**3. Key Relationships:**\n   - Relationship between FPTP and Other Voting Systems: Recognise how the structure and functioning of FPTP differs from or is similar to other voting systems.\n   - Relationship between FPTP and Electoral Outcomes: Understand how FPTP can influence who wins an election.\n   - Relationship between FPTP and Political Landscapes: Understand how FPTP can shape the political landscape, including party dominance and representation.\n\n**4. Practical Applications:**\n   - Detailed Case Study of FPTP in the UK: Examine how FPTP works in practice in the UK, including recent elections as examples.\n   - Comparison with Other Countries: Briefly compare the use and effects of FPTP in the UK with its use and effects in other countries that use the same system.\n\n**5. Common Challenges:**\n   - Understanding the Complexity of FPTP: FPTP may seem simple on the surface but understanding its deeper implications can be challenging.
